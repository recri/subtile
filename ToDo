Old todos:
[ ] Allow sweeping deletions
[x] Generate vertex atlases

New todos:
[x] enable fourier transform
[x] test fourier transform
[ ] test lots of things
[ ] use snit to simplify code

Another do list for subtile:
   4) make dissections go in adjacent pieces rather than skipping around
   8) color the tiles
   10) clip a tiling to a disk or polygon
   14) graphically edit prototiles and dissection rules
   16) generate vertex atlases
   17) generate tile names from vertex atlases
   18) color tiles according to names
   19) save and restore tilings as tcl
   20) reproduce edge markings
   21) figure out where the holes in the tiling are coming from

To do list for fourier:
   1) allow the computation to be aborted
   2) save images to ppm files
   3) reload saved images
   4) compute layers to improve the resolution of an existing image
